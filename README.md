This repo contains code for sentiment analysis using [BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert), and a comparison with a naïve Bayes classifier (using a subjectivity filter) on two datasets: the [first dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/) was compiled by Andrew Maas et al. in the 2011 paper *Learning Word Vectors for Sentiment Analysis*, and the [second dataset](https://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/) was introduced by [Pang and Lee](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/llee/papers/pang-lee-stars.home.html), and improved by Richard Socher et al. in the 2013 paper *Recursive Deep Models for Semantic Compositionality Over a Sentiment Treebank*.
